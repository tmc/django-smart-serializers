========================
django smart serializers
========================

Project Goals
=============

1. Be backwards compatible in deserialzing django core serializer output
2. Allow fixtures to not include primary keys if a model can be described with a subset of fields other than the primary key.
3. Allow references to other models to be described with a lookup dictionary in addition to a primary key.
4. Once complete, provide as a patch to django proper.
